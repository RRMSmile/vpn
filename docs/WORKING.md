# CloudGate: Working Guide (dev + ops)

This document is the source of truth for day-to-day work:
local setup, running services, and basic ops workflows.

## Repositories and remotes

Primary repo: CloudGate (monorepo, pnpm workspaces)

Expected remotes:
- origin / github -> GitHub (main collaboration + PRs)
- optional: wslrepo -> local mirror for WSL workflows

Check:
git remote -v
git branch -vv
